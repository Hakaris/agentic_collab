Yes, we should definitely bring water bottles with us in case we get thirsty.
Great, let's grab some snacks, a flashlight, a blanket, and water bottles and head to the river. We can regroup in 15 minutes and compare our findings.
Hey Klaus, while we're searching, let's also keep an eye out for any good hiding spots for future games.
Should we also bring a map of the park with us?
No, I don't think we need a map. We can explore and find new hiding spots as we search.
Hey Maria! Have you found a good hiding spot yet?
No, I haven't found a good hiding spot yet. Have you?
Let's search near the river. It could be a good spot.
That sounds like a good idea. Let's go check near the river together.
Let's bring snacks and a blanket with us as well.
Should we also bring a flashlight in case it gets dark?
Yes, let's bring a flashlight too. It might get dark near the river.
Do you think Adam and Abigail will join us?
Let's invite Adam and Abigail to join us.
Should we send them a message now?
Yes, let's message Adam and Abigail now and invite them to join us.
I'll send them a message right now.
Let's meet at the treehouse first and then go to the river together.
I just got a message from Adam. He said they are on their way to the park.
Let's wait for Adam and Abigail at the treehouse and then we can all go to the river together.
Should we wait for them at the treehouse or should we go to the river and wait there?
Hey Klaus, any luck finding the players?
No, I haven't found them yet. Have you seen Maria or Abigail?
No, I haven't seen them either. I was just looking for a new hiding spot. Let's keep searching together.
Let's split up and search different areas of the park. I'll check the west side, and you can search the east side.
Sure, I'll search the east side of the park. Let's meet back in 15 minutes to compare our findings.
Alright, let's meet back in 15 minutes and see if we found any of the players. Good luck!
