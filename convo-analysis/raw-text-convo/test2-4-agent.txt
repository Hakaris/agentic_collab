Hey Maria! How are you doing today?
Hey Isabella! I'm doing great, just enjoying this game of hide and seek. How about you?
I'm doing well too! I've been thinking of a new hiding spot, do you have any suggestions?
Sure, I have a few ideas. How about we try hiding behind the big tree near the playground? It's a pretty secluded spot and I don't think Klaus Mueller has checked there yet.
That sounds like a great idea! Let's go hide behind the big tree near the playground.
Okay, let's go quickly before Klaus finds us!
Do you think we should tell others to hide there too?
I think it's best if we keep it just between us for now. If we tell others, they might tell Klaus.
You're right, let's keep it between us for now. We don't want Klaus to find out.
We should also make sure to have a signal or a secret code to let each other know if Klaus gets close. How about we whistle softly if he's nearby?
That's a great idea! Let's come up with a secret whistle so we know when Klaus is nearby.
We can use a code word as well, like 'pineapple' to mean Klaus is close. That way, even if others overhear us, they won't know what it means.
I like the idea of using a code word! Let's use 'pineapple' as our signal.
Do you think we should come up with a backup hiding spot as well?
Yes, I think having a backup hiding spot is a good idea. Let's brainstorm some options.
We can try hiding behind the bushes near the picnic area. It's another secluded spot that Klaus might not check.
