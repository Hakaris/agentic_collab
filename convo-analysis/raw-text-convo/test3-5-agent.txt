That sounds like a great spot, Abigail! I found a few hiding spots near the big oak tree, the fountain, and the swing set. They seem pretty good too.
We should make sure our hiding spots are far apart from each other so Klaus doesn't find us all at once.

Yes, I think it's a good idea to have a backup plan. Let's think of a safe place we can go to if Klaus gets too close.
How about we hide in the small cave near the lake? It's hidden and not many people go there.

We should also come up with a specific phrase or word as a signal to find a new hiding spot if needed.
That's a good idea, Abigail! Let's use the word 'pineapple' as our signal to find a new hiding spot if needed.
Should we let Maria and Adam know about our backup plan and the signal too?

Hey Maria! I noticed you were walking towards Johnson Park. Are you planning to hide or were you just passing by?
Yes, I'm planning to hide. I love playing hide-and-seek in the park!
That's great! I'm actually the seeker in the game right now. Have you seen Isabella or Abigail anywhere?
No, I haven't seen Isabella or Abigail anywhere. I just arrived at the park. Maybe we can team up and help each other find them?
Sure, that sounds like a great idea! Let's team up and search for Isabella and Abigail together.
Do you have any ideas of where they might be hiding?
I heard Isabella and Abigail talking about a spot behind a big oak tree near the swing set, a small cave near the lake, a spot behind the bushes near the playground, and a small tunnel near the playground leading to a secret hiding spot. Let's start by checking those places.
Let's split up and check those places separately. I'll start with the spot behind the big oak tree near the swing set.
Alright, I'll check the small cave near the lake first. Let's meet back here in 10 minutes to share any updates.
Okay, see you in 10 minutes!
Also, let's agree on a signal to use if we find Isabella or Abigail. How about three short whistles followed by two long whistles?
Should we exchange phone numbers so we can stay in touch while we search for Isabella and Abigail?
Sure, let's exchange phone numbers. Here's mine: 555-1234.
I don't have my phone with me today, but I'll keep an eye out for Isabella and Abigail. Let's meet back here in 10 minutes and share any updates.

Hey Adam! Have you found any good hiding spots yet?

We should also check out the small tunnel near the playground. It might lead to a secret hiding spot!

Let's be careful and stay quiet while exploring the small tunnel. We don't want to give away our hiding spots.
Hey Klaus, have you checked behind the big oak tree near the swing set? It's a great hiding spot!
Thanks for the suggestion, Maria. I'll definitely check behind the big oak tree near the swing set.
And don't forget to look near the fountain and behind the bushes near the playground. Those are also good hiding spots!

That sounds perfect! I can't wait to see it.
It's just a short walk from here. Follow me!
Thanks for showing me these hiding spots, Maria! I think they will work really well for our game.
Let's continue exploring and find more hiding spots!
Thank you, Maria! I appreciate you showing me these hiding spots. Let's keep looking for even more hiding spots together!
I think we should also come up with a signal in case Klaus gets too close. What do you think?

That sounds like a great spot, Abigail! I found a few hiding spots near the big oak tree, the fountain, and the swing set. They seem pretty good too.
We should make sure our hiding spots are far apart from each other so Klaus doesn't find us all at once.
Yeah, you're right! It's better if we spread out and hide in different areas. Let's each choose a hiding spot and meet back here in 30 minutes to check in.
That sounds like a plan, Maria. Let's meet back here in 30 minutes and share any updates on our progress.
Do you think we should come up with a signal in case Klaus gets too close?

That's a great idea, Maria! Let's use 'pineapple' as our signal. If one of us says it, we'll know it's time to find a new hiding spot. Good luck!
I'll go hide near the swing set. See you in 30 minutes!
I'll go hide near the large tree by the entrance. See you in 30 minutes!
