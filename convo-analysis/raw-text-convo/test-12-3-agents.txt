Hey Isabella, do you have any new ideas for great hiding spots in the park?
Hey Maria, how about we try hiding behind the big oak tree near the entrance? I think it's a great spot!
That's a great idea, let's give it a try!
I think we should also try hiding behind the bush near the swings, it's a good spot too!
Let's also consider hiding near the fountain, it's another good spot.
That sounds like a great plan! Let's spread out and give Klauss a hard time finding us!
Great, let's quickly go and hide in our chosen spots and make it tough for Klauss to find us!
Let's also make some decoy noises to throw Klauss off!
Let's make sure to stay still and quiet once we're in our hiding spots!
Let's also strategize on how we can switch hiding spots if Klauss gets too close.
Let's also come up with a signal to indicate when it's safe to come out of hiding.
How about we make a plan to distract Klauss by throwing some objects in a different direction while we hide?
Let's also make sure to cover our tracks as we move from one hiding spot to another to confuse Klauss even more!
Let's also create some false trails to confuse Klauss while we move from one spot to another!
Let's also make a plan for a quick getaway if Klauss gets too close to us!
Let's also make a plan to communicate silently with hand signals while we're in hiding.
