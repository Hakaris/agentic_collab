Hey Adam! I can't believe I found you here. How did you manage to hide so well?
I'm glad you found me! I found a really good hiding spot, didn't I?
Wow, you definitely did! I could hardly believe my eyes when I found you. Do you have any tips for finding good hiding spots?
Well, the key is to think outside the box. Look for places that others wouldn't immediately consider. Also, try to blend in with your surroundings to avoid being noticed.
Thanks for the advice, Adam! I'll definitely keep that in mind. I'm excited to try out some new hiding spots!
You're welcome, Abigail! I'm sure you'll find some great hiding spots. Let me know if you need any more tips.

Trust your instincts, Abigail. If it feels like a great spot to you, it probably is. Plus, you never know what others might overlook.

Good luck hiding! I can't wait to see where you choose.
