Look for places that are well-hidden and where you can blend in with your surroundings. It's also important to be patient and observe the seeker's movements, so you can adjust your hiding spot if needed. And finally, always have a backup plan in case your initial hiding spot is discovered. This way, you can quickly find a new spot without being caught. I hope these tips help you with your book!"
