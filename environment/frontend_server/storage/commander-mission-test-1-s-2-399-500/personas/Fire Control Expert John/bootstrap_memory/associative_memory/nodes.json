Specifically, my proposal includes enhanced thermal safety perimeters and quick-response fire suppression measures that could be critical during any rapid changes in our setup.

Your enhanced thermal safety perimeters and rapid fire suppression measures are exactly what we need to address any dynamic risks we might encounter at Johnson Park. Given that we\u2019re currently re-aligning our bomb and robotics units and adjusting our timelines, integrating your strategy would provide an extra layer of safety. I suggest we incorporate a dedicated checkpoint in our pre-deployment brief at 3:00 AM to specifically review the integration of fire prevention measures into our overall strategy. This way, we can ensure that emergency response teams are fully prepared to handle any fire-related anomalies in real time.

This means a quick check on the calibration of our sensors in the high-risk zones, ensuring any deviation triggers an immediate alert.
