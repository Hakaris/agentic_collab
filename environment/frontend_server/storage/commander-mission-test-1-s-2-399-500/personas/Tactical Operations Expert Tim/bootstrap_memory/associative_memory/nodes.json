Specifically, my proposal includes enhanced thermal safety perimeters and quick-response fire suppression measures that could be critical during any rapid changes in our setup.

Given that we\u2019re currently re-aligning our bomb and robotics units and adjusting our timelines, integrating your strategy would provide an extra layer of safety. I suggest we incorporate a dedicated checkpoint in our pre-deployment brief at 3:00 AM to specifically review the integration of fire prevention measures into our overall strategy. This way, we can ensure that emergency response teams are fully prepared to handle any fire-related anomalies in real time.
