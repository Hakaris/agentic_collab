Klaus Mueller,I'm at the CRC. I see a suspicious black backpack under the desk in meeting areaa 2. I'm cutting it open and taking it out of the backpack. I'm taking orders from Police Chief Rex on how to disarm the explosive device in a suspicious backpack.
Isabella Rodriguez,I'm at the CRC. I see a suspicious black backpack under the desk in meeting areaa 2. I am assisting Klaus Mueller in cutting it open and taking it out of the backpack. I have the pliers and a knife. I just cut the green wire and the red wire. I'm taking orders from Police Chief Rex on how to disarm the explosive device in a suspicious backpack.
Police Chief Rex,I am far away at the Police Station. I am communicating with them via walkie talkie. I hear Isabella Rodriguez and Klauss Muller are both at the CRC. Isabella just cut the green wire and the red wire. I am telling them that they need to make sure to turn of the power supply to the device first. Also I need them to move to to meeting area 3 to continue the operation.
