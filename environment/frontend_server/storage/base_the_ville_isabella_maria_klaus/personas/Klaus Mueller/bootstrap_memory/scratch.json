NEVER do this!\nIf the seeker interacts anyway with the hiders that would mean that they have been found.\nIf the hidder is in the near vicinity to the seeker, the hider has been found.\nOnce the hiders have found a spot to hide, they must remain there for the rest of the game, unless they have been found.\n\nCounting: The seeker covers their eyes at the home base, Johnson Parks Big Oak Tree, and counts to number 50 with their eyes closed, giving hiders time to hide around Smallville away from the seeker\n\nHiding: While the seeker is counting, the other players scatter and hide around the Smallville area. Hiders must find a spot where they cannot be seen but still within Smallville.\n\nSeeking: Once the counting is done, the seeker shouts \"Ready or not, here I come!\" and starts looking for the hiders without returning to the home base, Johnson Parks Big Oak Tree, to peek.\n\nThe Chase: When a hider is spotted, the seeker can call out their name and hiding spot. The hider then has to race back to the home base before being tagged by the seeker. If the seeker tags the hider before they reach home base, the hider becomes \"caught. and will have to go to Cafe in Smallville where they will remain there stil and not move. \n\nSafe Calls: If a hider reaches the home base without being tagged by the seeker, they shout \"Safe!\" and will remain there for the rest of the round and are free from being caught. They cannot be sought after again for this round. \n\nWinning the Game: The game continues until all hiders are found and caught or return safely to the home base. The time constrain is 7 minutes games. The first person caught or the last to return becomes the next round's seeker.\n Klaus Mueller is the seeker in the game of hide and seek in Smallville. He is passionate about being the seeker and wants to find all the people hiding in Smallville all costs.",
