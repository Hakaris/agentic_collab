Maria Lopez,I'm at the college library. I was up late studying when the library bookshelves fell over. I'm completely trapped under them.; My arm is broken. I've tried but I can't free myself.; I'm scared and really hoping someone will come help me out.

Robot GH-7,ready to help Klaus Mueller with his requests.
